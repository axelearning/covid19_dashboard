# Covid19 Dashboard ðŸ¦ 
Through this project I designed a dashboard that tracks the propagation of covid19. 

The data are retrieved daily from this [directory](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series) Github. Then they are processed to feed the different visualization
